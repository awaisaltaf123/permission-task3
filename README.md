## Project Structure

The folder structure of this app is explained below:

| Name                 | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **node_modules**     | Contains all npm dependencies                                                                      |
| **package json**     | Contains all the info related to the project setup and any packages that are installed             |
| **page.tsx**         | The main file where the project is running                                                         |
| **app/LeftBox.tsx**  | Contains two boxes one with the input field and submit button and other with the placeholder text. |
| **app/RightBox.tsx** | Display the image on the right.                                                                    |

### Running the build

All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.

| Npm Script | Description                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`    | Runs complete build and runs node on dist/index.js. Can be invoked with `npm run dev` |
| `test`     | Runs the unit tests. Can be gathered with `npm test`                                  |
| `lint`     | Runs build and run tests using jest. Can be gathered with `npm lint`                  |
